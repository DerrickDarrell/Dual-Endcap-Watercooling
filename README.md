# **Dual-Endcap-Watercooling**

## INTRODUCTION
Stepper motors in high-performance 3D printers can run hot under heavy loads, especially when pushing high current/voltage or driving long duty cucles in enclosures. Some solutions out there at the moment only pull heat from one side of the motor, which leaves the opposite end and bearing region to run hotter. Dual endcap watercooling solves this by pulling heat evenly from both ends of the motor body.

## WHY IT MATTERS

- **Lower operating temperatures**
               - Higher sustained current
- **Better thermal symmetry**
               - Both endcaps and bearings stay closer in temperature, reducing shaft expansion and improving dimensional stability. Expansion is in the microns but enough to influence backlash, runout, and wear
- **Longer motor life**
               - Cooler windings and bearings, less insulation breakdown
- **Consistent performance**
               - Torque output remains stable during long prints or high duty operations
- **Larger water cavity**
               - More surface area for heat transfer

## INSTALLATION

- These water blocks will work on any Nema 17 stepper motor as long as the hole pattern is 31x31 and the shaft hub does not exceed 22mm in diameter. Your typical LDO or omc motor falls under that. (check beforehand)
